@article{Chen.2000,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The entity-attribute-value representation with classes and relationships (EAV/CR) provides a flexible and simple database schema to store heterogeneous biomedical data. In certain circumstances, however, the EAV/CR model is known to retrieve data less efficiently than conventionally based database schemas.

OBJECTIVE

To perform a pilot study that systematically quantifies performance differences for database queries directed at real-world microbiology data modeled with EAV/CR and conventional representations, and to explore the relative merits of different EAV/CR query implementation strategies.

METHODS

Clinical microbiology data obtained over a ten-year period were stored using both database models. Query execution times were compared for four clinically oriented attribute-centered and entity-centered queries operating under varying conditions of database size and system memory. The performance characteristics of three different EAV/CR query strategies were also examined.

RESULTS

Performance was similar for entity-centered queries in the two database models. Performance in the EAV/CR model was approximately three to five times less efficient than its conventional counterpart for attribute-centered queries. The differences in query efficiency became slightly greater as database size increased, although they were reduced with the addition of system memory. The authors found that EAV/CR queries formulated using multiple, simple SQL statements executed in batch were more efficient than single, large SQL statements.

CONCLUSION

This paper describes a pilot project to explore issues in and compare query performance for EAV/CR and conventional database representations. Although attribute-centered queries were less efficient in the EAV/CR model, these inefficiencies may be addressable, at least in part, by the use of more powerful hardware or more memory, or both.},

@article{Chen.2015,
 abstract = {As a fundamental task in computer architecture research, performance comparison has been continuously hampered by the variability of computer performance. In traditional performance comparisons, the impact of performance variability is usually ignored (i.e., the means of performance observations are compared regardless of the variability), or in the few cases directly addressed with i-statistics without checking the number and normality of performance observations. In this paper, we formulate a performance comparison as a statistical task, and empirically illustrate why and how common practices can lead to incorrect comparisons. We propose a non-parametric hierarchical performance testing (HPT) framework for performance comparison, which is significantly more practical than standard i-statistics because it does not require to collect a large number of performance observations in order to achieve a normal distribution of sample mean. In particular, the proposed HPT can facilitate quantitative performance comparison, in which the performance speedup of one computer over another is statistically evaluated. Compared with the HPT, a common practice which uses geometric mean performance scores to estimate the performance speedup has errors of 8.0 to 56.3 percent on SPEC CPU2006 or SPEC MPI2007, which demonstrates the necessity of using appropriate statistical techniques. This HPT framework has been implemented as an open-source software, and integrated in the PARSEC 3.0 benchmark suite.},

This paper explores these issues and discusses why biomedical data are difficult to model using conventional relational techniques. The authors propose a solution to these obstacles based on a relational database engine using a sparse, column-store architecture. The authors provide benchmarks comparing the performance of queries and schema-modification operations using three different strategies: (1) the standard conventional relational design; (2) past approaches used by biomedical informatics researchers; and (3) their sparse, column-store architecture. The performance results show that their architecture is a promising technique for storing and processing many types of data that are not handled well by the other two semantic data models.},

@article{Duftschmid.2010,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

The ISO/EN 13606 Electronic Health Record architecture standard permits semantically interoperable exchange of Electronic Health Record data by using archetypes to define the structure and semantics of Electronic Health Record contents. Practical implementations of the ISO/EN 13606 standard have been scarcely reported on, and none of the publications describes in detail an efficient technique of archetype-compliant data extraction from an Electronic Health Record system. We address this research issue in the present report, and focus on a specific class of largely research-oriented Electronic Health Record systems which are internally based on the Entity-Attribute-Value Model.

METHOD

We propose an approach for extracting data described by archetypes from an Entity-Attribute-Value based Electronic Health Record system in an ISO/EN 13606-conformant manner. The approach is based on mapping from the structure of exported source documents to the archetype. It is implemented via standard XML technologies.

RESULTS

We tested our approach on an Electronic Health Record system employed for clinical research at the Medical University of Vienna. Using test data defined by three different archetypes, source documents were successfully extracted as archetype-conformant ISO/EN 13606 Electronic Health Record extracts.

CONCLUSIONS

Electronic Health Record data may be effectively extracted from Entity-Attribute-Value based Electronic Health Record systems using the suggested approach. As a prerequisite for applying our approach, the internal data model of the Electronic Health Record system and the archetype must overlap in a way that a semantic mapping between them is possible. The system must further provide an XML interface which permits the export of the source documents in conventional format. The export must include data and metadata that are mandatorily postulated by the archetype and the ISO/EN 13606 Reference Model.},

 abstract = {Relational databases are getting bigger and more complex. Also, current Database Management Systems (DBMSs) need to respond efficiently to operations on their data. In this context, database optimization is evident as a process of refining database systems, aiming to improve their throughput and performance. This paper evaluates and compares the performance of Oracle and PostgreSQL database systems with the TPC-H benchmark, following a strategy of adding column-based indexes to optimize query execution. Ten TPC-H queries are performed on tables without any restrictions, with primary and foreign keys and with index constraints. The performance in each set of executions is analyzed. The results allow inferring a positive impact when using constraints with a significant speedup as well as better throughput. Oracle has shown stability and robustness for queries, with best results in scenarios with poor performance conditions. However, PostgreSQL showed shorter execution times after the optimizations made and proved to be more sensitive. Global performance results show that Oracle can improve 7{\%} performance with indexes and PostgreSQL 91{\%}. When comparing the results of Oracle with PostgreSQL, no indexes, Oracle/PostgreSQL is 64{\%} faster, and with indexes, PostgreSQL/Oracle is 75{\%} faster.},

@article{McDougal.2017,
 abstract = {Neuron modeling may be said to have originated with the Hodgkin and Huxley action potential model in 1952 and Rall's models of integrative activity of dendrites in 1964. Over the ensuing decades, these approaches have led to a massive development of increasingly accurate and complex data-based models of neurons and neuronal circuits. ModelDB was founded in 1996 to support this new field and enhance the scientific credibility and utility of computational neuroscience models by providing a convenient venue for sharing them. It has grown to include over 1100 published models covering more than 130 research topics. It is actively curated and developed to help researchers discover and understand models of interest. ModelDB also provides mechanisms to assist running models both locally and remotely, and has a graphical tool that enables users to explore the anatomical and biophysical properties that are represented in a model. Each of its capabilities is undergoing continued refinement and improvement in response to user experience. Large research groups (Allen Brain Institute, EU Human Brain Project, etc.) are emerging that collect data across multiple scales and integrate that data into many complex models, presenting new challenges of scale. We end by predicting a future for neuroscience increasingly fueled by new technology and high performance computation, and increasingly in need of comprehensive user-friendly databases such as ModelDB to provide the means to integrate the data for deeper insights into brain function in health and disease.},

@article{Nadkarni.1999,
 abstract = {Entity-attribute-value (EAV) representation is a means of organizing highly heterogeneous data using a relatively simple physical database schema. EAV representation is widely used in the medical domain, most notably in the storage of data related to clinical patient records. Its potential strengths suggest its use in other biomedical areas, in particular research databases whose schemas are complex as well as constantly changing to reflect evolving knowledge in rapidly advancing scientific domains. When deployed for such purposes, the basic EAV representation needs to be augmented significantly to handle the modeling of complex objects (classes) as well as to manage interobject relationships. The authors refer to their modification of the basic EAV paradigm as EAV/CR (EAV with classes and relationships). They describe EAV/CR representation with examples from two biomedical databases that use it.},

The conventional horizontal row representation fails to meet these requirements. We represent objects in a vertical format storing an object as a set of tuples. Each tuple consists of an object identifier and attribute name-value pair. Schema evolution is now easy. However, writing queries against this format becomes cumbersome. We create a logical horizontal view of the vertical representation and transform queries on this view to the vertical table. We present alternative implementations and performance results that show the effectiveness of the vertical representation for sparse data.

 abstract = {Over the years, different meanings have been associated to the word consistency in the distributed systems community. While in the '80s {\textquotedbl}consistency{\textquotedbl} typically meant strong consistency, later defined also as linearizability, in recent years, with the advent of highly available and scalable systems, the notion of {\textquotedbl}consistency{\textquotedbl} has been at the same time both weakened and blurred.  In this paper we aim to fill the void in literature, by providing a structured and comprehensive overview of different consistency notions that appeared in distributed systems, and in particular storage systems research, in the last four decades. We overview more than 50 different consistency notions, ranging from linearizability to eventual and weak consistency, defining precisely many of these, in particular where the previous definitions were ambiguous. We further provide a partial order among different consistency predicates, ordering them by their semantic {\textquotedbl}strength{\textquotedbl}, which we believe will reveal useful in future research. Finally, we map the consistency semantics to different practical systems and research prototypes.  The scope of this paper is restricted to non-transactional semantics, i.e., those that apply to single storage object operations. As such, our paper complements the existing surveys done in the context of transactional, database consistency semantics.},
